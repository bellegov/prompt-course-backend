•	I designed and developed a backend for an interactive educational platform from scratch, using a microservice architecture on the Spring Cloud (Eureka, API Gateway) to ensure independent scaling and fault tolerance of services.
•	Implemented three independent services: user-service (authentication, profiles, subscriptions), course-service (content management) and progress-service (tracking progress and game mechanics). Implemented a hybrid authentication system: seamless login via Telegram Mini App (with initData verification) and classic registration/Email login/A password, including a mechanism for securely combining accounts. 
•	Developed a complex system of gamification and user retention, including a common "wallet" of lives with a 3-hour cooldown, tracking statistics (lessons completed, days in a row) and a dynamic "library" of studied products. 
•	Integrated a subscription-based monetization system using the YooKassa API, including processing web hooks to automatically activate premium access. 
•	Optimized performance for high loads by implementing caching (Redis) for frequently requested data and asynchronous cache invalidation via a message broker (Apache Kafka).
